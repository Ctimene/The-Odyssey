                        Welcome To My First Website!
                    </h1>
                    <p class="hero-text">
                        This is an incredibly simple website created to showcase my beginner skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
                        It is a personal project that I started to learn the basics of web development and to create a platform where I can share my thoughts, ideas, and future projects. <br>
                        It features a simple design, containing four seperate pages: Home, About, Blog, and Contact. With this being the Home page, the About page detailing information about Ctimene, the Blog page details random thoughts, and the Contact page being pretty self-explainitory. <br>
                        Each page is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, though there may be a few bugs here and there. Especially in being a first project, it is likely riddled with small issues. 
                        Therefore, for the sake of kindness and my dwindling sanity, please turn a blind eye if the issue isn't resulting in the complete inability to use the website itself. <br>
                        <br>
                        Feel free to explore the site and see what I've learned so far. <br>
                        I hope you enjoy your visit! <br>
